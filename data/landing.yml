      Automate processes that involve your organization's data using:


      * **API** - all functionalities are exposed by REST API

      * **Webhooks** - outgoing webhooks are a simple way that defguard can notify your systems of ongoing changes in: identity ( user was added, deleted, modified) or hardware key provisioning ( easily propagate pgp/gpg or ssh keys to your internal systems)

    name: Web 3
    description: >-
      Integration with Web3/blockchain functionalities. Since defguard secures
      the whole user journey/connections, from secure communication using VPN,
      then authentication based on company identity and Multi-Factor
      Authentication ( supporting crypto wallets), it's a perfect web2 -> web3
      gateway for your organization.


      * Wallet management - with MetaMask and Wallet Connect - an easy way for users to validate the ownership of wallets - no need to sed wallet addresses through slack/email anymore

      * Organizational self-custody wallets ( in development) - create a self-custody, multi-sig company wallet

      * Blockchain transactions for organizations ( in development) - since company members can securely connect/expose their wallets and the organization has a self-custody multi-signature wallet, the next step is to enable transactions on the blockchain

      * Blockchain node management ( in development) - connect, monitor, and manage your own blockchain nodes

      * Easy deployment - we support easy deployment using

        * Docker Compose
        * Kubernetes - using Helm Chart
