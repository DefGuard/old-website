    Building a **secure organization** has always been **difficult** and **costly**. Defguard provides a beautiful, easy-to-use (business users) and deploy (admin/devops) fundament to make your organization secure.

      The power of every organization is its users. As a core principle,
      defguard is based and built on open standards:


      * [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/connect/) ﻿based Identity Provider

      * **[OpenLDAP](https://www.openldap.org/)** synchronization - currently supporting users and groups synchronization

      * **[P﻿ostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)** as core data backend

      * In development:

        * Active Directory synchronization

    name: Wireguard VPN Management
    description: >-
      * **multiple VPN Locations** (networks/sites) - with defined access (all
      users or only Admin group)

      * multiple Gateways for each VPN Location (**high availability/failover**) - supported on a cluster of routers/firewalls for Linux, FreeBSD/PFSense/OPNSense

      * **import** your current WireGuard server configuration with a **wizard**!

      * **dashboard and statistics overview** of connected users/devices for admins

      * automatic IP allocation

      * kernel (Linux, FreeBSD/OPNSense/PFSense) & userspace WireGuard support with our Rust library

      * **Time-based** **One-Time Password** Algorithm (TOTP - e.g. Google Authenticator)

      * **WebAuthn / FIDO2** - for hardware key authentication support

      * **Web3** - authentication with crypto software and hardware wallets using Metamask, Wallet Connect, Ledger Extension

      Secure remote enrollment process, during which the user can: double-check
      their data, setup their password, and add their initial device to access
      VPN as a nice wizard!


      A﻿fter enrollment the user can b﻿e onboarded with relevant company information, links to company systems, security guidelines, etc. In the enrollment module, you can write custom messages using markdown that will be shown on the last step of the enrollment process and sent to the user via email.

      defguard was **thoroughly and comprehensively audited** by one of the best
      **security researchers in Poland: [ISEC](https://isec.pl)**. ISEC is also
      a strategic partner of defguard, reviewing every major release from a
      security perspective, making defguard one of the most secure core
      components in the open source ecosystem.


      A﻿ll Critical and Major issues [have been fixed in dedicated pull requests](https://github.com/DefGuard/defguard/pulls). Retest will follow soon (we'll notify on our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/defguard_net)).

      Automate processes that involve your organization's data using:


      * **API** - all functionalities are exposed via REST API

      * **Webhooks** - outgoing webhooks are a simple way for defguard to notify your systems of ongoing changes in identity management (user was added, deleted, modified) or hardware key provisioning (easily propagateGPG/PGP or SSH keys to your internal systems)

      Since defguard secures the whole user journey (connections), from secure
      communication using VPN, to authentication based on company identity and
      **Multi-Factor Authentication (supporting crypto wallets)**, it's a
      perfect web2 -> web3 gateway for your organization.


      Wallet management with **MetaMask** and **Wallet Connect** is an easy way for users to validate the ownership of wallets as there is no need to send wallet addresses through Slack/email anymore.

    description: We've implemented defguard in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
      for **code portability, security, and speed**. You can easily run defguard
      on various Linux-based systems on x86, arm, and other architectures
      (including Raspberry PI, OpenWRT, etc.) and Unix systems FreeBSD, OpenBSD,
      and others. We've prepared various [Linux and
      OPNSense](https://defguard.gitbook.io/defguard/features/setting-up-your-instance)
      (FreeBSD) but we are constantly working on other platforms.
