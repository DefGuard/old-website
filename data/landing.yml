    Building a **secure organization** has always been **difficult** and **costly**. Defguard provides a beautiful, easy-to-use (business users) and deploy (admin/devops) fundament to make your organization secure.

      The power of every organization is its users. As a core principle,
      defguard is based and built on open standards:


      * **[OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/connect/)**

      * **[OpenLDAP](https://www.openldap.org/)** synchronization - currently supporting users and groups synchronization

      * **[P﻿ostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)** as core data backend

      * In development:

        * Active Directory synchronization

      MFA is currently supported with the following methods:


      * **Time-based** **One-Time Password** Algorithm (TOTP - e.g. Google Authenticator)

      * **WebAuthn / FIDO2** - for hardware key authentication support

      * **Web3** - authentication with crypto software and hardware wallets using Metamask, Wallet Connect, Ledger Extension

      Based on open source [Wireguard protocol](https://wireguard.net/),
      designed to manage multiple sites/gateways, enables:


      * User managed - users manage their devices at any time easily

      * Activity & Statistics - detailed analytics, graphs, and connection activity for administrators

      * Easy setup - defguard Wireguard gateway supports Linux and [OPNsense](https://opnsense.org/) (FreeBSD)

      * In development:

        * Activity streams
        * Easy access for new users - share VPN configuration for users in a secure way, enabling them to download and configure VPN configurations with one email
        * Desktop clients with MFA support
        * Global Map overview

    description: "defguard was **thoroughly and comprehensively audited** by one of
      the best **security researchers in Poland: [ISEC](https://isec.pl)**. ISEC
      is also a strategic partner of defguard, reviewing every major release
      from a security perspective, making defguard one of the most secure core
      components in the open source ecosystem."

      Automate processes that involve your organization's data using:


      * **API** - all functionalities are exposed via REST API

      * **Webhooks** - outgoing webhooks are a simple way for defguard to notify your systems of ongoing changes in identity management (user was added, deleted, modified) or hardware key provisioning (easily propagateGPG/PGP or SSH keys to your internal systems)

      Since defguard secures the whole user journey (connections), from secure
      communication using VPN, to authentication based on company identity and
      **Multi-Factor Authentication (supporting crypto wallets)**, it's a
      perfect web2 -> web3 gateway for your organization.


      Wallet management with **MetaMask** and **Wallet Connect** is an easy way for users to validate the ownership of wallets as there is no need to send wallet addresses through Slack/email anymore.

    description: We've implemented defguard in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
      for **code portability, security, and speed**. You can easily run defguard
      on various Linux-based systems on x86, arm, and other architectures
      (including Raspberry PI, OpenWRT, etc.) and Unix systems FreeBSD, OpenBSD,
      and others. We've prepared various [Linux and
      OPNSense](https://defguard.gitbook.io/defguard/features/setting-up-your-instance)
      (FreeBSD) but we are constantly working on other platforms.
