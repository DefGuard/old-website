      * **API** - all functionalities are exposed by REST API

      * **Webhooks** - outgoing webhooks are a simple way that defguard can notify your systems of ongoing changes in: identity ( user was added, deleted, modified) or hardware key provisioning ( easily propagate pgp/gpg or ssh keys to your internal systems)
